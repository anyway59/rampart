An arduino semi-modular synth companion to keep, moat and bastl's kastle.

The prototype uses an Arduino Nano. The Mozzi library is used for synthesis.

Analog Pins 0-3 are potentionmeters. Analog pins 4-7 (4 not yet used) are used for modulation signal inputs.

Digital Pin 9 is audio (PWM) out. Digital 2 and 3 are buttons (2 being used to switch presests currently).

The sketch here is still rough are electrical questions (modulate on the pots directly?) are being explored.

A fritzing sketch is included to illustrate the basics.
